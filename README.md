## How to Use:
To use the user simple enters the desired city in the search box and presses enter. After the user presses enter, the current weather and five day forecast are displayed on the right hand side. Cities that the user entered are preserved in the search history and can also be clicked on again to show the weather instead of having to retype.

## What Makes it Work:
- Open Weather Map API
- Javascript - In the Javascript several functions are required to alter the raw data from the Open Weather API and format it correctly.

## Features:
- Visual cues (icons/pics) for matching weather
- Search history -persistent data
- Clean and simple interface

## Areas for Improvement:
An icon for the search button can also be added to improve the UI experience for the customer. Additionally, it may be more intuitive for the user to be able to simply press "enter" to render weather results. A dark or light mode may also be of interest, or a F to C trigger. It might also be more aesthetically pleasing to have a page with some default information load for first time users so that the page isn't blank.
